I have been preparing to apply for the M.A. in Global Affairs at Jackson, but cannot find reference to that degree option on the Jackson website anymore. What happened to it?
Hey! Thank you for your question! Let me explain this in a simple way. In short, Jackson no longer offers M.A. programs in Global Affairs. Instead, now it offers M.P.P. program.
I know that Jackson offered M.A. program in global affairs. However, now it only offers M.P.P MPP Mater in Public Policy program. Can you tell me what happened?
I am glad that you asked this question! As Jackson became a professional school in Fall 2022, JAckson decided to launch Master in Public Policy (M.P.P.) programs instead of M.A. programs in Global Affairs.

Why did Jackson introduce the masters in public policy M.P.P. program instead of the M.A.in global affairs?I get this question a lot! So, I am glad that you raise this question.The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Yale is mostly Ph.D. program, so as you're poking around within the application form, you will probably notice that it's very very Ph.D. focused. So Jackson is a professional program we consider our sell our Master's degrees terminal degrees that you can receive these degrees and go out and do international policy and get on the get in the field and go make a difference in the world. That's part of the reason for their change from an MA to an MPP. We wanted to signal that we are professional program, not an academic program toward Ph.D.
